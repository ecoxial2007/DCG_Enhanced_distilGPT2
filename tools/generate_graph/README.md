# Step 2: Extract Entities and Generate Adjacency Matrix

This step involves extracting entities and generating an adjacency matrix for each case.

---

## 1. Process Reports
- `process.py`: This script extracts disease-free and disease-specific pairs from each report and saves them in a CSV file.

## 2. Generate Adjacency Matrix
- Based on `annotation_top5.json ` and `generate_adjmatrix.py` , this script generates an adjacency matrix for each case.

**Note:** Currently, we provide only the key code snippets. You are welcome to modify our code to implement entity extraction and graph construction. A detailed tutorial will be updated later.
